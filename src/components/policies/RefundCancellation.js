                <p><strong>1.</strong>Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made 7 days of placing the order. However,
                    cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to such sellers /
                    merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or the
                    product is out for delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.</p>

                    In case you feel that the product received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations,
